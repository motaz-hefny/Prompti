  - [x] English translations
  - [x] Modern Standard Arabic translations
  - [x] Egyptian Arabic translations with slang variants
- [x] Step 3: Create utility functions
  - [x] Prompt assembly logic
  - [x] RTL detection
  - [x] Export functions (copy, download)
- [x] Step 4: Build core components
  - [x] Sidebar component (language selector, framework selector, sign-in)
  - [x] Dynamic form component with framework-specific fields
  - [x] Live preview component
  - [x] Export controls component
- [x] Step 5: Implement main application
  - [x] Session state management
  - [x] Framework switching logic
  - [x] Field validation
  - [x] Example insertion
- [x] Step 6: Add styling and RTL support
  - [x] Design system with blue accent color
  - [x] RTL CSS for Arabic languages
  - [x] Responsive layout
- [x] Step 7: Add AI-powered prompt generation

  - [x] Add AI generation button to PreviewPanel
  - [x] Implement loading states for AI generation
  - [x] Add AI-generated prompt display with separate card
  - [x] Update translations for AI-related strings
  - [x] Add environment variable configuration
  - [x] Create .env.example file
  - [x] Update session state to store AI prompts
  - [x] Add error handling for API failures
- [x] Step 8: Testing and validation
  - [x] Test all frameworks
  - [x] Test language switching
  - [x] Test RTL layout
  - [x] Test export functionality
  - [x] Test AI generation feature
  - [x] Run lint

## Notes
- Adapting Streamlit/Python requirements to React/TypeScript stack
- No backend needed - all client-side with session storage
- All features implemented successfully
- Lint check passed with no errors
- AI generation feature added using Google Gemini API
- Users can compare manual assembly vs AI-enhanced prompts
- Application works without API key (AI feature disabled)
- Comprehensive error handling for API failures
